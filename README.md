Main assignment for NWT


This is a project work based on the trainings I received from NWT, 2019.
Here I employed several web development skills I we were taught basically; HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT to design a health management website as a solution to the number three item(Good Health and Well-being) of the SDG goals.

Considering the high cost of healthcare today in the society, this site is targeted at providing comprehensive health insurance packages for the populace.

It is expected that this scheme will help ameliorate the financial burden associated with the prevalent cost of healthcare.

Thanks to NWT for this amazing opportunity. I am so excited and cannot wait to take on new challenges.
